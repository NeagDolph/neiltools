The goal here, unlike normal free writing, is to pay as little attention as possible to what you write. \n\nThis technique helps soothe anxiety and tension by allowing you to bring troubling thoughts to the surface and let them go."

    "content": "Whenever free writing: \n\n- Never stop to think, just keep writing.\n\n- Never censor yourself or edit your writing - It's alright to write things that you don't agree with.\n\n- Never read what you wrote or show other people - the goal is to never judge what comes out"

But when I was starting it took much longer.\n\nWhen first beginning, it may take a while of writing before you start feeling like that weight of anxiety is being lifted off your chest. Keep at it and don't give up."

    "title": "Tips for beginners",
    "content": "If you have trouble writing, try starting with a leading sentence and writing from there. \n\nSuch as \"I feel like...\" or \"I am anxious because...\" and let yourself write whatever comes to your mind. \n\nYou can also try just writing gibberish. If you can't think of what to write just start pressing random letters until you've got your flow again."
